# **Face Recognition Event Manager**

A web application that uses facial recognition for user authentication and allows users to register, log in, and participate in events. Each user can view and manage their selected events.

---

## **Features**

### **1. User Registration**
- Users can register by providing:
  - A username.
  - A password.
  - A photo for facial recognition.
- The app:
  - Hashes and stores the password.
  - Extracts and saves the facial encoding from the uploaded photo.

### **2. User Login**
- **Facial Recognition Login:** Users upload a photo, and the app matches it with stored facial encodings.
- **Username and Password Login:** Users log in with their credentials.

### **3. Event Management**
- **Available Events:** Users can view a list of events and join them.
- **User Events:** Each user can see only the events they have joined.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLite, Werkzeug.
- **Facial Recognition:** `face_recognition` library.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
